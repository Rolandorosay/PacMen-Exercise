# PacMen-Exercise

This is a factory for making PacMen. When you hit the "Add PacMan" button another PacMan will appear on the screen. To start the game and have the PacMen running around the screen just hit the "Start Game" button.

The exercise was created to show how an image can change and run across the screen in random directions and at random speeds. PacMan will bounce around chomping. (still working on getting him to chomp and switch directions)

I would like to add to this project in the future by adding a fruit (maybe a cherry) in the center of the screen, and when one happens to eat the fruit the screen will turn into a dark mode and and start playing some deep house music lol. Like if PacMan hit the magic "Party Mode" switch. ðŸŽ‰
